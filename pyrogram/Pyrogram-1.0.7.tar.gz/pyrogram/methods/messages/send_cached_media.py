        """Send any media stored on the Telegram servers using a file_id.

        This convenience method works with any valid file_id only.
        It does the same as calling the relevant method for sending media using a file_id, thus saving you from the
        hassle of using the correct method for the media the file_id is pointing to.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            file_id (``str``):
                Media to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send a media that exists on the Telegram servers.

            file_ref (``str``, *optional*):
                A valid file reference obtained by a recently fetched media message.
                To be used in combination with a file id in case a file reference is needed.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Media caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.
                Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
                Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
                Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            schedule_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Date when the message will be automatically sent. Unix time.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: On success, the sent media message is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                app.send_cached_media("me", "CAADBAADzg4AAvLQYAEz_x2EOgdRwBYE")
